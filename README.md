# Housing-Price-Predictor
This project analyzes a kaggle housing dataset to determine the optimal number of features used to predict housing price using a multiple regression model and decision tree regressor.

## Motivation
This project aims to solve the problem of being able to quantify how much a home is worth based off some common features such as number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and area.

## Methods and Results
A multiple regression model and decision tree regressor are used to predict housing price. The multiple regression model yielded better results than the decision tree model which is indicated by a lower mean squared error on testing data.
